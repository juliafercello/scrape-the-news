# Project Overview
This project is a site scraping app that scrapes Tech News from NPR. 

Users are able to initiate scraping news (which is then saved to a mongoDB), view article details, view/add/remove comments for an article and remove all articles so the scraping fun can start all over. 

The project utilizes node, express, handlebars, mongoose, cheerio, axios and bootstrap.
